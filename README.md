## Research Scope & Motivation

This repository aims to explore technical topics across the broader field of computer science, including Large Language Models (LLMs), machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and related computational methods. With the rapid progress of these technologies, numerous research questions have emerged concerning model architectures, reasoning capabilities, data processing methods, evaluation protocols, and algorithmic behavior. Through small-scale, focused experiments, this repository seeks to deepen understanding of these topics in an exploratory manner.

## Areas of Exploration

The studies in this repository span a wide range of topics, including:

* Analysis of reasoning characteristics and behavioral properties of Large Language Models (LLMs)
* Reproduction and evaluation of ML/DL model experiments
* Examination of NLP and information extraction tasks
* Investigation of algorithmic principles and numerical computation behavior
* Experimental implementation of new methodologies and techniques in computer science

## Research Interests

I am particularly interested in:

* **Causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs**, and
* **Cognitive and logical constraints in natural language processing (NLP)**

These interests connect directly to fundamental questions about how models acquire knowledge, how reasoning processes emerge, and under what conditions they break down. Many experiments in this repository are driven by these core research motivations.

## Background and Perspective

Although I am currently engaged in computational research, my formal academic background is not in computer science. I originally specialized in atmospheric sciences and fluid dynamics. As a result, my approach is grounded in:

* Mathematical and physical modeling
* Reasoning consistency and structural coherence
* Model validation and interpretability

By applying these principles, I aim to explore how LLMs and ML models represent information, form reasoning chains, and encounter failure modes.

## Collaboration

I have a strong interest in academic research and research-oriented development.
If you share similar interests and would like to discuss ideas or explore opportunities for collaboration, I would be happy to hear from you.
I am open to a wide range of cooperation—from informal technical discussions to more structured research projects.
